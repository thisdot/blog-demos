# Harnessing the Power of Threlte - Building Reactive Three.js Scenes in Svelte

In this tutorial, we'll showcase Threlte's capabilities by building an engaging website header: an auto-rotating sphere that changes color on mouse down. Using Threlte v6, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) 1.0, and Three.js, we're set to create a visually stunning experience. Let's dive in!
